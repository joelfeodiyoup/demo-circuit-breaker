Please focus on these files:

- code implemented in `circuit-breaker.ts`
- testing added in `circuit-breaker.test.ts`
- uml diagram: `uml_diagram.jpg` - please note that the UML diagram is quite a rough / fast attempt.

The circuit-breaker part can be run by:
- clone the repo
- do an `npm install`
- run `npm run test`
